# 2.1：变量类型

任何一个编程语言都需要考虑如何存储与恢复变量。PHP也不例外。很多语言都是强类型，变量一旦生命，在其生命周期内类型固定不变。



	typedef struct _zval_struct {
		zvalue_value value;
		zend_uint refcount;
		zend_uchar type;
		zend_uchar is_ref;
	} zval;


	typedef union _zvalue_value {
		long lval;
		double dval;
		struct {
			char *val;	
			int len;
		} str;
		HashTable *ht;
		zend_object_value obj;
	} zvalue_value;



ONE THING EVERY PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE SHARES IN COMMON is a means to store and retrieve information; PHP is no
exception. Although many languages require all variables to be declared beforehand and that the type of information
they will hold be fixed, PHP permits the programmer to create variables on the fly and store any type of information
that the language is capable of expressing. When the stored information is needed, it is automatically converted to
whatever type is appropriate at the time.
Because you've used PHP from the userspace side already, this concept, known as loose typing, shouldn't be
unfamiliar to you. In this chapter, you'll look at how this information is encoded internally by PHP's parent language,
C, which requires strict typecasting.
Of course, encoding data is only half of the equation. To keep track of all these pieces of information, each one
needs a label and a container. From the userspace realm, you'll recognize these concepts as variable names and
scope.
