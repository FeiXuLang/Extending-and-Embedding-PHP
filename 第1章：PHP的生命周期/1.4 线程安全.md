1.4 线程安全

早期的PHP只是作为单个CGI进程运行，其流程是：PHP初始化，然后接受一个请求，处理请求之后销毁进程，所以并不关心线程安全的问题。因此，在进程里的变量


之后，PHP被嵌入了多进程web服务器中，典型的例子是Apache。

随后，单进程多线程web服务器开始出现，

Zend Thread Safety
When PHP was in its infancy, it ran as a single process CGI and had no concern for thread safety because no
process space could outlive a single request. An internal variable could be declared in the global scope and accessed
or changed at will without consequence so long as its contents were properly initialized. Any resources that weren't
cleaned up properly would be released when the CGI process terminated.
Later on, PHP was embedded into multiprocess web servers like Apache. A given internal variable could still be
defined globally and safely accessed by the active request so long as it was properly initialized at the start of each
request and cleaned up at the end because only one request per process space could ever be active at one time. At
this point per-request memory management was added to keep resource leaks from growing out of control.
As single-process multithreaded web servers started to appear, however, a new approach to handling global data
became necessary. Eventually this would emerge as a new layer called TSRM (Thread Safe Resource Management).
